/*Level-2: Problem 2 - Product Stock and Sales Analysis
Scenario:
The inventory manager wants to compare stock availability and total quantity sold for each product.
📌 Requirements
1. Display product_name, store_name, available stock quantity, and total quantity sold.
2. Include products even if they have not been sold (use appropriate join).
3. Group results by product_name and store_name.
4. Sort results by product_name.
🛠️ Technical Constraints
- Use LEFT JOIN between stocks and order_items.
- Use INNER JOIN with products and stores tables.
- Use GROUP BY clause.
- Use SUM() aggregate function.
- Use ORDER BY clause.
Expectations:
Students should correctly use different join types (INNER and LEFT), grouping, and aggregate functions.
🎯 Learning Outcome 
Develop strong understanding of different JOIN types (INNER, LEFT), aggregation, grouping data, and analyzing relational datasets.*/

    ON st.product_id = p.product_id
INNER JOIN stores s 
    ON st.store_id = s.store_id
LEFT JOIN order_items oi 
    ON p.product_id = oi.product_id
GROUP BY 
    p.product_name,

ORDER BY 
    p.product_name;
